# python-gitUpdateRemoteIP
Script to automatically update all .git folder configs with new remote IP. Can also change http to ssh authentication.

## Why?
You have bought a new RPI (and did not bother setting up mDNS) so now you are hosting your local Gitlab server on a different IP and all your local .git folders still point to the old URL. Instead of manually updating every single folder just run this script once.
